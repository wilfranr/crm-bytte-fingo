The application will automatically reload whenever you modify any of the source files.\nAPI endpoint\nThe base URL of the backend API is defined in src/environments/environment.ts and src/environments/environment.prod.ts. Update these files if your backend runs on a different host or port.\nCode scaffolding\nAngular CLI includes powerful code scaffolding tools. To generate a new component, run:\nExample :ng generate component component-nameFor a complete list of available schematics (such as components, directives, or pipes), run:\nExample :ng generate --helpBuilding\nTo build the project run:\nExample :ng buildThis will compile your project and store the build artifacts in the dist/ directory. By default, the production build optimizes your application for performance and speed.\nRunning unit tests\nTo execute unit tests with the Karma test runner, use the following command:\nExample :ng testRunning end-to-end tests\nFor end-to-end (e2e) testing, run:\nExample :ng e2eAngular CLI does not come with an end-to-end testing framework by default.

Permite seleccionar archivos Excel (.xlsx, .xls) para su procesamiento.\nIndicador de Progreso: Durante el procesamiento del archivo, se muestra una barra de progreso (p-progressbar) para indicar el estado de la operación.\nBotón de Descarga de Reporte MIID: Se ha añadido un botón que permite descargar directamente un reporte desde la plataforma MIID. La URL de este reporte se construye dinámicamente con las fechas del primer día del mes anterior al primer día del mes actual, facilitando la obtención de datos relevantes.\nDiseño y Distribución: Se ha mejorado la distribución general de los elementos en la interfaz, utilizando clases de PrimeFlex para un diseño más limpio y organizado.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n
